        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          More advanced schooling helps. If you can avoid the crushing debt of student loans, all the better. Try to find a major that
          you're good at and that is good to you.<br>

        enders are able to become more wealthy than the education high enders. So before being born, shop around.<br>
